# Natural-Condition-Monitoring-System-Affected-by-Floods-Based-on-Iot-Using-APRS-Utilization
This is my project in 2020 to fulfill the internship program during three months at PT LAPAN Bogor, Indonesia using HTML, CSS, Javascript, phpMyAdmin, MySQL, Arduino, and C Programming. This system can be run by website which is integrated with APRS data from one of PT LAPAN's satellites, aiming to determine the location of evacuation points in disaster affected areas with a weather condition information data interface, location of coordinates, humidity, and cardinal directions in real time on the aprs.fi site that is accessible to everyone.
